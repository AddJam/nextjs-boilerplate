Below are some of my general impressions for each game, along with a rating comparing how I felt about the game before and after playing (not interested, intrigued, excited, day-one purchase). If you have any specific questions about any of these games, I&amp;#39;ll try to answer to the best of my ability in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Just a couple notes: (1) I wasn&amp;#39;t able to hit every Nindie at the show\u2014I know for sure that I missed Monster Boy, Steamworld Dig 2, Toejam and Earl, and Yooka-Laylee (the line for that one was insane). (2) Unless noted, I played all of these games on actual Switch hardware. (3) I also ran into Damon Baker at the show\u2014he is really approachable, and seemed genuinely surprised that a fan recognized him. Okay, on to the reviews.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DANDARA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Intrigued&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; Not interested&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the one game that I downgraded because of my personal gaming tastes. I&amp;#39;m not a huge fan of Metroidvania games, so that put me off a bit. But the main mechanic is very interesting\u2014each area is essentially a series of corridors, and you can only move by bouncing back and forth between landing pads on the walls. You can shoot enemies as well, but you have to manually aim the shot and make sure nothing&amp;#39;s about to hit you in the meantime. The art style is an &amp;quot;upgraded&amp;quot; pixel look that I liked more than I thought I would. One important note: This game is VERY DIFFICULT\u2014if I remember correctly, I died after only one or two hits. I think fans of the genre will like this game, but it just wasn&amp;#39;t my cup of tea.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLIPPING DEATH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Intrigued&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; (Significantly less) Intrigued&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This is the only game I walked away from before my time was up. It has a neat art style, and a few clever ideas, but some serious flaws at this point. The biggest is that the controls and gameplay aren&amp;#39;t explained well, at least in the demo. I had a mission and knew that I had to possess people to complete it, but that&amp;#39;s about it\u2014there was nothing intuitive about my next steps. I ended up just possessing people and then running around the map until I got frustrated. The developer assigned to my station didn&amp;#39;t try to help\u2014he just kept scanning the crowd while I was obviously flailing. At one point, someone came over and handed them an award, and they immediately started fussing over where to put it and getting a good picture for social media instead of talking to people playing their game. I think the flaws can be corrected prior to launch, but this was probably my worst experience of the day.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GONNER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Not interested&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; Excited&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This was the game that surprised me the most. First off, it has a very unique minimalist art style, which I really enjoyed. Also, the music and sound are great\u2014the game recently won a sound award at GDC. The controls and level design could be a little bit tighter, but that&amp;#39;s pretty much standard fare for a roguelike. Here&amp;#39;s the one thing that really threw me: When you die, you don&amp;#39;t go back to the beginning of your current level. You start at the beginning of a brand new level that has been completely re-generated. You&amp;#39;re immediately given a different weapon and power-up item, and off you go. The change was so jarring that I assumed I had been sent to a &amp;quot;loser&amp;#39;s bracket&amp;quot; where I had to work my way back up. The developer later explained that the levels are so short, everything is constantly re-spawning. I had a really good time with this game\u2014definitely one to keep an eye on.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRACEFUL EXPLOSION MACHINE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Excited&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; Day-one purchase (jamming my credit card into the Switch)&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Holy hell, you guys. THIS GAME. The art style is incredible. It&amp;#39;s perfect for short play sessions and on-the-go gaming. I only had two concerns going in\u2014juggling all the weapons and being able to discern what was happening on-screen\u2014and they were both put to rest by the end of the demo. The controls are tight, and the game does a good job of easing you in, one weapon and mechanic at a time, and then ramping up the difficulty once you get into a rhythm. I met the lead developer Mo at the booth, and he was incredible to talk to. He has as much energy as anyone I&amp;#39;ve ever met, and you can tell that he&amp;#39;s not only proud of his game, but he&amp;#39;s proud that it&amp;#39;s a Switch exclusive. People of reddit: this is a game that deserves our support\u2014and it doesn&amp;#39;t hurt that it&amp;#39;s beautiful and fun to play. Best game I played all show, no contest.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OVERCOOKED&lt;/strong&gt; (not Switch hardware)&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Day-one purchase&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; Day-one purchase&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve watched a number of Overcooked videos since it was announced for Switch, and I thought I had a good understanding of how the game worked and how to be successful. Boy, was I wrong\u2014watching and playing are two totally different animals. Team 17 hosted a daily high score contest, so I was on a team with three experienced players, and we still got our asses kicked. But it was still tons of fun. I think it&amp;#39;ll definitely be better with four players, so gauge your interest in this game based on whether you have access to (a) four Joy-Con and (b) three other people at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;REDOUT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Excited&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; Day-one purchase&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I know many of you are having the same internal struggle as I am\u2014Redout or Fast RMX? I decided to hold off on buying Fast RMX, and I&amp;#39;m really glad I did. Redout is one of the most beautiful games I&amp;#39;ve seen running on the Switch, and the gameplay definitely adds a few layers beyond your typical arcade racer. I really like the idea of controlling the pitch of your vehicle to strafe, although it didn&amp;#39;t seem to make as much of a difference on turns as it did while I was in the air. And, most importantly, I didn&amp;#39;t notice any rubber-banding during my demo. By the time I was done playing, I&amp;#39;d made my decision: this is the F-Zero successor for me (plus there&amp;#39;s a physical release!).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SNAKE PASS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Intrigued&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; Excited&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re either going to like this game or hate it based on how you feel about the controls. They&amp;#39;re very unique, and I still didn&amp;#39;t feel like I had gotten used to them by the time I finished my demo. While on the ground, you can slide forward, but you move more quickly if you slither back and forth. You press &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; to lift your head up, and hopefully hook a ledge or bamboo shoot to hoist yourself up. Climbing is a matter of curling yourself around and upward like a vine, using LR to tighten and loosen your grip. Other than that, it&amp;#39;s a fairly straightforward collection game\u2014there are orbs scattered throughout each level, four gems you need to collect to exit, and challenge coins in hard-to-reach places. Even though the controls were difficult, I didn&amp;#39;t walk away discouraged\u2014I wanted to play more and get better at them. Based on how busy the booth was, I think most people agreed with me.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THUMPER&lt;/strong&gt; (not Switch hardware)&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Excited&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; Intrigued&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;This game is very intense. Each level consists of fifteen &amp;quot;sections,&amp;quot; including a couple boss fights, and the difficulty ramps up as you go. By the later sections, success is as much about focus and endurance as it is about accuracy. For a rhythm game, it has very few controls\u2014everything in the level I played was some combination of pressing &amp;quot;A&amp;quot; and tilting left or right on the control stick. &lt;em&gt;[Note: a commenter added that new mechanics are added every level.]&lt;/em&gt; The inputs correspond to the twists and turns of the roller-coaster-esque track you ride through the level. The whole time, you&amp;#39;re also flying through a creepy hellscape, complete with trippy imagery and eye-popping visuals. The major problem I encountered (hence the downgrade) is the soundtrack. I know it&amp;#39;s been highly praised, but it&amp;#39;s mostly atmospheric house music\u2014not very memorable for repeat playthroughs, and really difficult to maintain a consistent rhythm while you&amp;#39;re playing. By the time I washed out on the last boss fight, I felt like I&amp;#39;d completed a low-grade workout, and I was happy to hand off the controller to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TUMBLESEED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;Before playing:&lt;/em&gt; Not interested&lt;br/&gt;\n&lt;em&gt;After playing:&lt;/em&gt; Excited&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I did not think I was going to like this game, and I still don&amp;#39;t know if I&amp;#39;m ultimately going to buy it. But I have a ton of respect for how creative the concept and mechanics are. I&amp;#39;ve honestly never played a game like it. This is another one where how you feel about the controls is going to dictate how you feel about the game, and there is definitely a learning curve. But I made it through the demo without dying once, and the developer said I got the hang of it more quickly than most people. This is definitely the type of game where you need to be slow and deliberate at times to succeed. Also, the art and music are KILLER\u2014I complimented the developer at the station on the music after I played, only to find out he was the composer! Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised, and I&amp;#39;d encourage those of you who dismissed this game as gimmicky to give it a second look.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;", "selftext": "I was at PAX East a couple weeks ago, and my mission was to play as many of the upcoming indie Switch games as I could.

Okay, on to the reviews.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**DANDARA**  \n*Before playing:* Intrigued  \n*After playing:* Not interested\n\nThis is the one game that I downgraded because of my personal gaming tastes. I'm not a huge fan of Metroidvania games, so that put me off a bit. But the main mechanic is very interesting\u2014each area is essentially a series of corridors, and you can only move by bouncing back and forth between landing pads on the walls. You can shoot enemies as well, but you have to manually aim the shot and make sure nothing's about to hit you in the meantime. The art style is an \"upgraded\" pixel look that I liked more than I thought I would. One important note: This game is VERY DIFFICULT\u2014if I remember correctly, I died after only one or two hits. I think fans of the genre will like this game, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**FLIPPING DEATH**  \n*Before playing:* Intrigued  \n*After playing:* (Significantly less) Intrigued\n\nThis is the only game I walked away from before my time was up. It has a neat art style, and a few clever ideas, but some serious flaws at this point. The biggest is that the controls and gameplay aren't explained well, at least in the demo. I had a mission and knew that I had to possess people to complete it, but that's about it\u2014there was nothing intuitive about my next steps. I ended up just possessing people and then running around the map until I got frustrated. The developer assigned to my station didn't try to help\u2014he just kept scanning the crowd while I was obviously flailing. At one point, someone came over and handed them an award, and they immediately started fussing over where to put it and getting a good picture for social media instead of talking to people playing their game. I think the flaws can be corrected prior to launch, but this was probably my worst experience of the day.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GONNER**  \n*Before playing:* Not interested  \n*After playing:* Excited\n\nThis was the game that surprised me the most. First off, it has a very unique minimalist art style, which I really enjoyed. Also, the music and sound are great\u2014the game recently won a sound award at GDC. The controls and level design could be a little bit tighter, but that's pretty much standard fare for a roguelike. Here's the one thing that really threw me: When you die, you don't go back to the beginning of your current level. You start at the beginning of a brand new level that has been completely re-generated. You're immediately given a different weapon and power-up item, and off you go. The change was so jarring that I assumed I had been sent to a \"loser's bracket\" where I had to work my way back up. The developer later explained that the levels are so short, everything is constantly re-spawning. I had a really good time with this game\u2014definitely one to keep an eye on.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**GRACEFUL EXPLOSION MACHINE**  \n*Before playing:* Excited  \n*After playing:* Day-one purchase (jamming my credit card into the Switch)\n\nHoly hell, you guys. THIS GAME. The art style is incredible. It's perfect for short play sessions and on-the-go gaming. I only had two concerns going in\u2014juggling all the weapons and being able to discern what was happening on-screen\u2014and they were both put to rest by the end of the demo. The controls are tight, and the game does a good job of easing you in, one weapon and mechanic at a time, and then ramping up the difficulty once you get into a rhythm. I met the lead developer Mo at the booth, and he was incredible to talk to. He has as much energy as anyone I've ever met, and you can tell that he's not only proud of his game, but he's proud that it's a Switch exclusive. People of reddit: this is a game that deserves our support\u2014and it doesn't hurt that it's beautiful and fun to play. Best game I played all show, no contest.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**OVERCOOKED** (not Switch hardware)  \n*Before playing:* Day-one purchase  \n*After playing:* Day-one purchase\n\nI've watched a number of Overcooked videos since it was announced for Switch, and I thought I had a good understanding of how the game worked and how to be successful. Boy, was I wrong\u2014watching and playing are two totally different animals. Team 17 hosted a daily high score contest, so I was on a team with three experienced players, and we still got our asses kicked. But it was still tons of fun. I think it'll definitely be better with four players, so gauge your interest in this game based on whether you have access to (a) four Joy-Con and (b) three other people at the same time.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**REDOUT**  \n*Before playing:* Excited  \n*After playing:* Day-one purchase\n\nI know many of you are having the same internal struggle as I am\u2014Redout or Fast RMX? I decided to hold off on buying Fast RMX, and I'm really glad I did. Redout is one of the most beautiful games I've seen running on the Switch, and the gameplay definitely adds a few layers beyond your typical arcade racer. I really like the idea of controlling the pitch of your vehicle to strafe, although it didn't seem to make as much of a difference on turns as it did while I was in the air. And, most importantly, I didn't notice any rubber-banding during my demo. By the time I was done playing, I'd made my decision: this is the F-Zero successor for me (plus there's a physical release!).\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**SNAKE PASS**  \n*Before playing:* Intrigued  \n*After playing:* Excited\n\nYou're either going to like this game or hate it based on how you feel about the controls. They're very unique, and I still didn't feel like I had gotten used to them by the time I finished my demo. While on the ground, you can slide forward, but you move more quickly if you slither back and forth. You press \"A\" to lift your head up, and hopefully hook a ledge or bamboo shoot to hoist yourself up. Climbing is a matter of curling yourself around and upward like a vine, using LR to tighten and loosen your grip. Other than that, it's a fairly straightforward collection game\u2014there are orbs scattered throughout each level, four gems you need to collect to exit, and challenge coins in hard-to-reach places. Even though the controls were difficult, I didn't walk away discouraged\u2014I wanted to play more and get better at them. Based on how busy the booth was, I think most people agreed with me.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**THUMPER** (not Switch hardware)  \n*Before playing:* Excited  \n*After playing:* Intrigued\n\nThis game is very intense. Each level consists of fifteen \"sections,\" including a couple boss fights, and the difficulty ramps up as you go. By the later sections, success is as much about focus and endurance as it is about accuracy. For a rhythm game, it has very few controls\u2014everything in the level I played was some combination of pressing \"A\" and tilting left or right on the control stick. *[Note: a commenter added that new mechanics are added every level.]* The inputs correspond to the twists and turns of the roller-coaster-esque track you ride through the level. The whole time, you're also flying through a creepy hellscape, complete with trippy imagery and eye-popping visuals. The major problem I encountered (hence the downgrade) is the soundtrack. I know it's been highly praised, but it's mostly atmospheric house music\u2014not very memorable for repeat playthroughs, and really difficult to maintain a consistent rhythm while you're playing. By the time I washed out on the last boss fight, I felt like I'd completed a low-grade workout, and I was happy to hand off the controller to someone else.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n**TUMBLESEED**  \n*Before playing:* Not interested  \n*After playing:* Excited\n\nI did not think I was going to like this game, and I still don't know if I'm ultimately going to buy it. But I have a ton of respect for how creative the concept and mechanics are. I've honestly never played a game like it. This is another one where how you feel about the controls is going to dictate how you feel about the game, and there is definitely a learning curve. But I made it through the demo without dying once, and the developer said I got the hang of it more quickly than most people. This is definitely the type of game where you need to be slow and deliberate at times to succeed. Also, the art and music are KILLER\u2014I complimented the developer at the station on the music after I played, only to find out he was the composer! Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised, and I'd encourage those of you who dismissed this game as gimmicky to give it a second look.", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Discussion", "id": "60oqn0", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 36, "report_reasons": null, "author": "CBattles6", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_60oqn0", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "self.NintendoSwitch", "hidden": false, "thumbnail": "self", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "edited": 1490117264.0, "link_flair_css_class": "discussion", "author_flair_css_class": "usericon-donkeykong-circle", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "is_self": true, "hide_score": true, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/60oqn0/impressions_all_the_nindies_i_played_at_pax_east/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1490143964.0, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/60oqn0/impressions_all_the_nindies_i_played_at_pax_east/", "author_flair_text": "NNID:", "quarantine": false, "title": "IMPRESSIONS: All the Nindies I played at PAX East", "created_utc": 1490115164.0, "distinguished": null, "media": null, "num_comments": 24, "visited": false, "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 36}}, {"kind": "t3", "data": {"contest_mode": false, "banned_by": null, "media_embed": {}, "subreddit": "NintendoSwitch", "selftext_html": null, "selftext": "", "likes": null, "suggested_sort": null, "user_reports": [], "secure_media": null, "link_flair_text": "Nintendo Official", "id": "60nihn", "gilded": 0, "secure_media_embed": {}, "clicked": false, "score": 71, "report_reasons": null, "author": "-Lampe-", "saved": false, "mod_reports": [], "name": "t3_60nihn", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/NintendoSwitch", "approved_by": null, "over_18": false, "domain": "nintendo.de", "hidden": false, "preview": {"images": [{"source": {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/fGWOHSnc5yIMkemmTbAGLKjjsJ_wp52v1eIcnVj47RY.jpg?s=c25c6a5028b568340c05fa1b366a3541", "width": 1000, "height": 1000}, "resolutions": [{"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/fGWOHSnc5yIMkemmTbAGLKjjsJ_wp52v1eIcnVj47RY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=108&amp;s=2c9d7aec16ce372499866191dc1fa352", "width": 108, "height": 108}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/fGWOHSnc5yIMkemmTbAGLKjjsJ_wp52v1eIcnVj47RY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=216&amp;s=6cea245face18846afd08858ac34afa6", "width": 216, "height": 216}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/fGWOHSnc5yIMkemmTbAGLKjjsJ_wp52v1eIcnVj47RY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=320&amp;s=4d7597b635ddbd7bfbe9445fa7b1bb91", "width": 320, "height": 320}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/fGWOHSnc5yIMkemmTbAGLKjjsJ_wp52v1eIcnVj47RY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=640&amp;s=8e45a11fdc980f9daec73e03ef8f581c", "width": 640, "height": 640}, {"url": "https://i.redditmedia.com/fGWOHSnc5yIMkemmTbAGLKjjsJ_wp52v1eIcnVj47RY.jpg?fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;arh=2&amp;w=960&amp;s=d09db8176a7640a38d74b6882a40b60e", "width": 960, "height": 960}], "variants": {}, "id": "QtaFphHuTbxPe1SdzGG_ZHUpGP8ADb80tgaXkItoYhY"}], "enabled": false}, "thumbnail": "https://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/YPNqs3Ine0ig9KSZYrTnwGDj1FkGcQAvpe4d8eX3Lyk.jpg", "subreddit_id": "t5_3h47q", "edited": false, "link_flair_css_class": "nintendo-official", "author_flair_css_class": "usericon-link-botw", "downs": 0, "brand_safe": true, "archived": false, "removal_reason": null, "post_hint": "link", "is_self": false, "hide_score": false, "spoiler": false, "permalink": "/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/60nihn/mario_kart_8_deluxe_and_arms_playable_at/", "num_reports": null, "locked": false, "stickied": false, "created": 1490131064.0, "url": "https://www.nintendo.de/News/Events/2017/Leipziger-Buchmesse-Erlesener-Spielspass-mit-Nintendo-Switch--1207702.html", "author_flair_text": "SW-3355-1908-9786", "quarantine": false, "title": "Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Arms playable at Leipziger Buchmesse/Manga-Comic-Con (23. -

Apparently he doesn&amp;#39;t actually know coding that well and would have to have a seperate team port the game.

href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/60hl6w/my_custom_breath_of_the_wild_canvas_came_in_today/?ref=share&amp;amp;ref_source=link\"&gt;see here&lt;/a&gt; ), I&amp;#39;m going to write out a quick write up for people that want to get one of the beautiful big canvases.  I will start by saying that it is actually bigger than you might think (unless you measure it).&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone has been using CanvasChamp (including myself), and it seems like they are a decent vendor for these things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;em&gt;Link&lt;/em&gt; (get it..)\nLink for correct canvas and size: \n&lt;a href=\"https://www.canvaschamp.com/my-canvas-design?size=1-1-30x40--c&amp;amp;sizeprice=2&amp;amp;catId=82\"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.canvaschamp.co.uk/my-canvas-design?size=1-1-30x40--c&amp;amp;sizeprice=2&amp;amp;catId=82\"&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.canvaschamp.com.au/my-canvas-design?size=1-1-30x40--c&amp;amp;sizeprice=2&amp;amp;catId=82\"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://www.canvaschamp.ca/my-canvas-design?size=1-1-30x40--c&amp;amp;sizeprice=2&amp;amp;catId=82\"&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2:&lt;/strong&gt; The Image\n&lt;a href=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/295/32278942595_906bf67afd_o.jpg\"&gt;https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/295/32278942595_906bf67afd_o.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\nIt&amp;#39;s a great  image ~12MB (thanks &lt;a href=\"/u/XsobervisionsX\"&gt;/u/XsobervisionsX&lt;/a&gt; for the link!)\nSelect upload image on canvas champ, let it do its thing, then ensure &amp;quot;Single Panel&amp;quot; is selected, as well as 30&amp;quot;x40&amp;quot; under &amp;quot;Thin Gallery Wrap&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3:&lt;/strong&gt; Framing Options\nI (and most users) did mirror wrap, and I was worried at first about how it would look, but it looks awesome.  Don&amp;#39;t worry about the moon wrapping, as you really won&amp;#39;t see it.  If you really care, you can do the border color wrap, but DO NOT DO THE Image Wrap, you will cut some of the awesomeness out.  I recommend the Mirror Image.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Leave finishing the same, and whatever you want for hanging purposes.

I will start by saying that it is actually bigger than you might think (unless you measure it).\n\nEveryone has been using CanvasChamp (including myself), and it seems like they are a decent vendor for these things.\n\n**Step 1**: The *Link* (get it..)\nLink for correct canvas and size: \n[US](https://www.canvaschamp.com/my-canvas-design?size=1-1-30x40--c&amp;sizeprice=2&amp;catId=82)\n[UK](https://www.canvaschamp.co.uk/my-canvas-design?size=1-1-30x40--c&amp;sizeprice=2&amp;catId=82)\n[Australia](https://www.canvaschamp.com.au/my-canvas-design?size=1-1-30x40--c&amp;sizeprice=2&amp;catId=82)\n[Canada](https://www.canvaschamp.ca/my-canvas-design?size=1-1-30x40--c&amp;sizeprice=2&amp;catId=82)\n\n**Step 2:** The Image\nhttps://c1.staticflickr.com/1/295/32278942595_906bf67afd_o.jpg\nIt's a great  image ~12MB (thanks /u/XsobervisionsX for the link!)\nSelect upload image on canvas champ, let it do its thing, then ensure \"Single Panel\" is selected, as well as 30\"x40\" under \"Thin Gallery Wrap\".\n\n**Step 3:** Framing Options\nI (and most users) did mirror wrap, and I was worried at first about how it would look, but it looks awesome.  Don't worry about the moon wrapping, as you really won't see it.  If you really care, you can do the border color wrap, but DO NOT DO THE Image Wrap, you will cut some of the awesomeness out.  I recommend the Mirror Image.\n\nLeave finishing the same, and whatever you want for hanging purposes. Note that \"Hooks for Hanging\" on a poster of this size come on the sides, and not in the center.  I do recommend this though, since it seems a single sawtooth may not fully support it.\n\n**Step 4:** Finishing touches\nThere is no image retouching needed, but I strongly recommend keeping the lamination.  I was worried that it would give it a glossy look at first, but its really just a protective layer, and I am glad I got it.\n\nGive the print a name (anything will do), approve the print, and you're good to go!\n\nHaving just looked at it, its a couple dollars cheaper than even I paid for it a few weeks ago, so now is a great time to do it.  All in all, the whole process should cost you less than $60 USD and should take just under 2 weeks to get to you (from India).\n\nLet me know if you have any questions.", "likes": null,
